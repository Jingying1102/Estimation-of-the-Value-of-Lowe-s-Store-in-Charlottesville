# Estimation-of-the-Value-of-Lowe's-Store-in-Charlottesville
This project is a final project of course Sample Survey @UVA. 
Lowes has a total of 34 departments at lowes.com. There are 2 to 21 different categories within each department. This project uses the concepts in sample survey to estimate of total value of Lowe's store in Charlottesville,VA.
# Sample Design
The sample selects 20 departments with replacement from the total of 26 valid departments. After obtaining the samples, to implement delete-1 Jackknife method, we deleted one psu (department in our problem) at a time and updated the weight for the rest observations. Then calculate the new estimator and further estimate the variance.
# Estimation
After calculation, our estimation of the total stock value of Lowes Charlottesville store is 43425888, with a 95% confidence interval of [25197668, 61654109].
